Sample Applications are deployed on top of a service mesh to help you explore and analyze your mesh's functionalities and features. They are also an excellent way to provide a consistent workload to run performance tests against.

## ICMP Application





## Deploy ICMP Application on Kuma

- Navigate to the **NSM Management** page from the Lifecycle Menu on Meshery and select `default` in the Namespace field.
- Select the `ICMP Responded` in the Manage Sample Application Lifecycle drop down menu.

You will be notified of successful deployment:

## Expose your Sample Application

A sidecar injector is used for automating the injection of the NSM proxy into your application's pod spec. The Kubernetes admission controller enforces this behavior by sending a webhook request to the sidecar injector every time a pod is to be scheduled.

You have already deployed the sidecar proxy injector when you installed NSM, which should be running in your control plane. To verify, execute this command:

`kubectl get deployment nsm-admission-webhook -n nsm-system`{{execute}}

**Let's verify that your deployment works. Run**:
(The *Available* column might take upto a minute to get updated)

`kubectl get deployment -n default`{{execute}}

Sample Output:

|        NAME           | READY | UP-TO-DATE | AVAILABLE | AGE |
|:---------------------:|:-----:|:----------:|:---------:|:---:|
| nsm-admission-webhook |  1/1  |      1     |     1     | 88s |
|     prefix-service    |  1/1  |      1     |     1     | 88s |

### Let's inspect our pod:

1. View the details of the deployed pods:

    `watch kubectl get po -n default`{{execute}} 

If you cannot see the *Ready* column updated, this is because the deployment can take up upto a minute. When the deployment is complete, the page will auto-refresh. You can use `CTRL+ C` to switch back to the terminal.

2. View the details of the services:

    `watch kubectl get svc -n default`{{execute}} 

3. Choose one of NSM's services (e.g. prefix-service), and view it's sidecar configuration:

    `kubectl get svc -n default`{{execute}}

    `kubectl describe svc/nsm-admission-webhook -n default`{{execute}}

4. Assess the application deployment by port-forwarding the web-service service:

    `kubectl port-forward svc/nsm-admission-webhook 8080 --address 0.0.0.0 -n default`{{Execute}}

The ICMP application should now be deployed on the HTTP port: `8080`. Make your way to the `ImageHub` Server tab. For this tutorial, the server is configured to be listening at `http://localhost:8080`
