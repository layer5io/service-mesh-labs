[Meshery](https://meshery.io/) is the service mesh management plane, offering lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and their workloads.

This session aims to provide a walkthrough on how to configure, setup and run the Meshery adapter for NSM. Once Meshery is set up, it can be extended to:

- Support and manage the performance of your service mesh and its workloads 

- Assess your service mesh against industry standards and the best operational practices

- Validate your service mesh's conformance to the Service Mesh Interface(SMI) specification

- Estimate the overhead features of your service mesh with the Service Mesh Performance(SMP) standard.
