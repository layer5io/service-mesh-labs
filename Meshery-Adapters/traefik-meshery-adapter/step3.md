Sample Applications are deployed on top of a service mesh to help you explore and analyze your mesh's functionalities and features. They are also an excellent way to provide a consistent workload to run performance tests against.

## ImageHub

[Image Hub](https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub) is a sample application created by the Layer5 community with the purpose of exploring Web Assemblies using WASM filters. Its features have now been expanded to allow Load Testing, Traffic Management etc.

## Deploy Image Hub on Traefik Mesh

- Navigate to the **Traefik Mesh Management** page on Meshery UI under `Lifecycle` menu with `default` in the Namespace field.
- Select the `Image Hub Application` in the `Sample Application` drop down menu.

You will be notified of successful deployment:

### Expose your Sample Application

A sidecar injector is used for automating the injection of the Linkerd proxy into your application's pod spec. The Kubernetes admission controller enforces this behavior by sending a webhook request to the sidecar injector every time a pod is to be scheduled.

You have already deployed the sidecar proxy injector when you installed Traefik Mesh, which should be running in your control plane. To verify, execute this command:

`kubectl get deployment consul-consul-connect-injector-webhook-deployment -n consul-system`{{execute}}

**Let's verify that your deployment works. Run**:
(The *Available* column might take upto a minute to get updated)

`kubectl get deployment -n default`{{execute}}

Sample Output:

|        NAME       | READY | UP-TO-DATE | AVAILABLE | AGE |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|:----------:|:---------:|:---:|
| api-deployment-v1 |  1/1  |      1     |     1     | 88s |
|       envoy       |  1/1  |      1     |     1     | 88s |
|   web-deployment  |  1/1  |      1     |     1     | 88s |

### Let's inspect our pod:

1. View the details of the deployed pods:

    `watch kubectl get po -n default`{{execute}} 

If you cannot see the *Ready* column updated, this is because the deployment can take up upto a minute. When the deployment is complete, the page will auto-refresh. You can use `CTRL+ C` to switch back to the terminal.

2. View the details of the services:

    `watch kubectl get svc -n default`{{execute}} 

3. Choose one of ImageHub's services (e.g. web-service), and view it's sidecar configuration:

    `kubectl get svc -n default`{{execute}}

    `kubectl describe svc/web-service -n default`{{execute}}

4. Assess the application deployment by port-forwarding the web-service service:

    `kubectl port-forward svc/web-service 8080 --address 0.0.0.0 -n default`{{Execute}}

The Image Hub application should now be deployed on the HTTP port: `8080`. Make your way to the `ImageHub` Server tab. For this tutorial, the server is configured to be listening at `http://localhost:8080`
